# Getting And Cleaning Data

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

### Dataset Description

This project dives into an exciting area of wearable computing, where a number of big brands compete to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

While the data for the project can be found here:

### Methodology

Create an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Outcome

1. a tidy data set based on the original data set
  * tidy_data.txt
2. a link to a Github repository with your R script for performing the analysis
  * run_analysis.R
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data  
  * CodeBook.md
